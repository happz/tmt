summary: Test type defining how tests should be executed

story:
    As a tester I want to include tests using different test
    execution framework in a single plan.

description: |
    The type defines how test code should be executed and how test
    results should be interpreted (e.g. checking exit code of a
    shell test versus checking beakerlib test results file). It
    also determines possible additional required packages to be
    installed on the test environment.

    Currently ``shell`` and ``beakerlib`` types are supported.
    Each `execute` step plugin should list which test types it
    supports and raise an error when unsupported type is detected.

    Should be a ``string``, by default ``shell`` is used.

example: |
    type: shell

    type: beakerlib

implemented: /tmt/base
